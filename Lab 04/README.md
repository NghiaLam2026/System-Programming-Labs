LAB TASK ðŸ’»: <br/> <br/>
  â–¾ Write a C program to calculate the time it takes for an object to reach the ground, it's velocity upon impact, and its kinetic energy at the moment of impact, given a user-specified height from which the object is dropped. <br/>

    Time Calculations: 
        â€¢ Formula: t = âˆš2h/g
        â€¢ Variable: 
            â€¢ t = time to reach the ground (seconds,s) 
            â€¢ h = height of the drop (meters, m)
            â€¢ g = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) 
  
    Velocity Calculations: 
        â€¢ Formula: v = g x t
        â€¢ Variables:
            â€¢ v = velocity upon ground impact (m/s)
            â€¢ g = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2)
            â€¢ t = time to reach the ground (s)

    Kinetic Energy Calculations:
        â€¢ Formula: e = 1/2mv^2
        â€¢ Variables:
            â€¢ e = kinetic energy at impact (Joules, J)
            â€¢ m = mass of the object (kilograms, kg)
            â€¢ v = velocity upon ground impact (m/s)

  <br/> â–¾ PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
  
        â€¢ Use 'float' or 'double' types for all variables. <br/>
        â€¢ Prompt the user to input the object's mass (kg) and the height of the drop (m). <br/>
        â€¢ Utulize the given formulas to compute the time taken, and kinetic energy, storing each result in a variable with a meaningful name.
        â€¢ Display the results formatted as follows: <br/>
            â€¢ "The time taken by an object weighing ___ kg to reach the ground when dropped from a height of __ meters is __ seconds."
            â€¢ "The velocity of the object when it hits the ground = ___ m/s."
            â€¢ "The kinetic energy at the momenet of impact with the ground is ___ Joules."
        â€¢ Ensure the program compilse and runs correctly on the Snowball server.
