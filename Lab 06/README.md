LAB TASK ðŸ’»: <br/>
<br/>    â–¾ Write two C programs to compare the performance of buffered and unbuffered I/O operations by writing a string to a file 1 millions times. 

<br/>
<br/>    â€¢ Unbuffered I/O Program:

        â€¢ Use the 'open()' and 'write()' system calls for file operations.
        â€¢ This approach directly interacts with the system's I/O, causing the program to suspend with each write operation
<br/>
<br/>    â€¢ Buffered I/O Programs:

        â€¢ Use the 'fopen()' and 'fprintf()' functions from the C standard library for file operations.
        â€¢ Buffered I/O batches multiple outputs together, reducing the number of suspensions and potentially improving performances.
<br/>
<br/>    â€¢ Performance Measurement:

        â€¢ Incorporate the 'time()' function from '<time.h>' to measure the duration of the file writing operations.
        â€¢ Record the current time before starting and after completing the 1 million writes to calculate the elapsed time.
<br/>
<br/>    â€¢ Output Requirements:

        â€¢ Each program should output a message every time a write or print operation is performed.
        â€¢ At the end of execution, both progarms should display the total time elapsed during the 1 million writes to the terminal
