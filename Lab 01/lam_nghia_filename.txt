Course Description
This course is designed to give students experience in using a high-level language (C) to interface with an
operating system (UNIX). Students will learn fundamental UNIX concepts, including files, processes,
interprocess communication, and shells. They will also gain experience writing and testing C programs
using UNIX editors and programming tools.

Course Outcomes

1. Proficient in using Remote Systems though SSH and SFTP.
2. Proficient in using UNIX/Linux Systems and Shell commands.
3. Write C programs to solve problems.
4. Demonstrate knowledge of process mechanisms such as pipe, fork, exec, etc...
5. Apply structs to access directory contents and/or process data.

Class Participation
Full participation is expected. Be ready to answer questions, work with others in a group, or solve
problems via Top Hat.
[7m--More--(40%)[27m[K
Attendance Policy
Lab attendance is mandatory for all students. If you miss your lab, you may make up the lab by
attending another lab during the same week. You must contact the TA in charge of that lab to request
attending. Space is limited and not all requests will be granted. If you experience an emergency that
forces you to miss a week or more, complete the Professor Absence Notification with the Dean of
Students at this link.

Attendance is vital to success in this class. Attendance will be taken either directly using Top Hat or
through participation in Top Hat questions.

Homework
There will be 4 or 5 homework assignments covering most topics in the course. Homework assignments
are to be completed individually unless specified otherwise. Homework will consist of larger
programming problems than the labs. You will need to break these down into smaller problems. It is
important to spend the time experimenting with the various program elements, so start your homework
promptly.

Submission
Homeworks and Labs must be turned in electronically on iCollege. Homeworks may be accepted one day
later with a 15% penalty. Labs must be turned in by the end of the day for your respective lab session.
Lab assignments will not be accepted after the deadline.

Exams
There will be 2 exams given in this course. The mid-term exam will be given in class on Tuesday,
February 7th, 2024. The final exam will be given in class on Tuesday, April 23rd, 2024. Because the exam
dates are announced in advance, there will be no make-up exams for unexcused absences.

Communication
Primary communication should be done via email to my @gsu.edu email address. Do not use the
iCollege internal mailing system. I do not check that inbox nor does it forward to my GSU email inbox.
Put the course number, 3320, in the subject line so I can differentiate between classes. If you have an
issue with grading, please speak with me during office hours.

I also have a @student.gsu.edu email address, but I do not check it regularly. Do not expect a fast
[7m--More--(71%)[27mresponse if it was sent to my student email address. Due to the way the email addresses are set up, my
student email address is the one that autocompletes.

Academic Dishonesty
All work, including homework, programming assignments, and exams, should be your sole work. You
should not work with other students on shared program solutions or use program solutions found on
the Internet. Specifically, you should never copy someone elseís solution or code, and never let a
classmate examine your code. If you are having trouble with an assignment, please consult with me, or
a TA.

You can find GSUís code of conduct for academic dishonesty at this link. If you are caught cheating or
plagiarizing, you will receive an immediate and final grade of ëFî and will be reported to the Dean of
Students. All parties will be treated equally, so I will not distinguish between the student who copies the
solution and the student who provided it.

Artificial Intelligence Statement
You are not allowed to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for any graded work in this course, including
lab assignments. Prohibited AI usage includes idea or text generation, writing or revising your work,
development of media assets, or data analysis and presentation. You may use a generative AI tool like
ChatGPT only when it is specifically permitted as part of an assignment.


Americans with Disabilities Act
ìStudents who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the Access
and Accommodation Center. Students may only be accommodated upon issuance by the Access and
Accommodation Center of a signed Accommodation Plan and are responsible for providing a copy of
that plan to instructors of all classes in which accommodations are sought.î

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mman[0m  is the system's manual pager. Each [4mpage[24m argument given to [1mman[0m is normally the name of a program, utility or function.[m
       The [4mmanual[24m [4mpage[24m associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed. A [4msection[24m, if provided,  will  direct[m
       [1mman[0m to look only in that [4msection[24m of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available [4msections[24m, follow‚Äê[m
       ing a pre-defined order and to show only the first [4mpage[24m found, even if [4mpage[24m exists in several [4msections[24m.[m
